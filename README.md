# Face-Recognition-Based-Door-Lock-System-

This project aims at combining automation and and security 
The idea behind is to provide security to homes without much effort spent by the owner of the house.
We have built a model which basically detects a face whenever a person is standing at the door. 
If the person is the owner or a permamnent resident of the house, the door lock opens automatically,
else an image is clicked and a mail is sent to the owner of the house asking for permission to open the door or not.
If he approves it the door opens else an appropriate message will be diplayed on the lcd screen placed infront of the door

Methodology

Face detetction and recognition

We have used Haar-cascade classifier algorithm for face detection
